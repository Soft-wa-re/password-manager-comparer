# [Password Manager Comparison](https://edelstone.github.io/password-manager-comparison)

This is a head-to-head evaluation of six password managers with a focus on enterprise needs and priorities.

The code and data was borrowed from a [Medium post by Jonathan Kamens of Quantopian Inc.](https://medium.com/@QuantopianCyber/head-to-head-evaluation-of-five-password-managers-8faa4851c767)

Styles were added by me. Data and code may be used pending it credits and respects the original authors (see note at the top of the JavaScript file).
